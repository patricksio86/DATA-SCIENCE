Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the World Happiness Report and gain insights into the factors influencing national happiness rankings. By exploring the report's data and utilizing various analytical techniques, the project aims to identify key determinants of happiness and understand the relationship between happiness and different life factors.

Description:

    Data Collection: The project will involve collecting the World Happiness Report data from multiple editions, including the years 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2023. The data will be sourced from the Gallup World Poll and other relevant surveys.

    Data Exploration: The collected data will be explored to understand the structure, variables, and trends present in the World Happiness Report. Descriptive statistical analysis, data visualization, and graphical representation will be used to gain insights into happiness levels across different countries.

    Happiness Ranking Analysis: The project will focus on analyzing the factors contributing to the happiness rankings of different countries. By examining the variables used in the report, such as life evaluations, life factors, and subjective well-being measurements, the project aims to identify the most significant determinants of national happiness.

    Comparative Analysis: The project will compare the happiness rankings across different years to identify any significant changes or trends. By performing year-on-year analysis, the project aims to understand the dynamics of happiness and explore whether certain countries consistently rank higher or lower in happiness over time.

    Correlation Analysis: Correlation analysis will be conducted to examine the relationship between happiness rankings and various life factors. Factors such as economic indicators, social issues, education, health, and government policies will be explored to determine their impact on national happiness.

    Predictive Modeling: The project will explore the possibility of building a predictive model to estimate happiness rankings based on the available data. Machine learning algorithms, such as regression or decision trees, may be employed to develop a model that can predict happiness levels for countries not included in the report.

    Visualization and Reporting: The project will include visualizations, charts, and graphs to present the findings in a clear and concise manner. A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, key insights, and conclusions will be created.

By analyzing the World Happiness Report data, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing happiness levels at a national level. The findings may provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and individuals interested in promoting happiness and well-being worldwide.
